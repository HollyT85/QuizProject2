<u><b>Overview</b></u><br>
I created a mythology quiz as I wanted to create an interactive game that people could enjoy; it is designed to allow people to both test their knowledge and to create some curiosity about some of the more 'obscure' myths. 

<u><b>Site Overview & UX</b></u>

I created the site using flex (researched via W3C) to make it responsive on all screen sizes which; as you can see above, it is. I wanted the quiz area to be centralised vertically on any screen size to ensure a full covering of the background image.

The colours have been chosen to match the background image colour; brown/orange and blue are complimentary colours on the colour wheel so I stuck to this theme as much as possible; the only deviations are the red/green for correct/incorrect answers.

Each new question updates the question number so users can see where they are in the quiz and there is a home page button should a user decide to leave to try a different level if they find it too easy/hard.

Before I started designing my quiz, I did some market research on how people prefer their quizzes to be; initially the majority said they would prefer to only know their score at the end however, when I did this and sent this out to my test group, they had changed their mind and said they would prefer to know if they got a question right/wrong as they went along. They said they did not want to know which was the right answer as, if they were interested, they would go away and research themselves and thus use it as a tool to learn things independently. It was widely felt that by being told the answer, there was no learning involved that would stay in their head and, as such, I changed my design to suit these opinions.
